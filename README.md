Python Programming Exercises
=============================
Here is a series of Python programming exercises. They are categorized by order of difficulty.

Adding Your Code
------------------
To add the code for your solution, it is recommended that you create a new git branch.
```
git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>
```

From your new branch you can open whatever file you like and use the provided function to create your solution. It is important that you use the function provided in the files so that they work with the intended unit tests. The output of the solution will be used to run the unit tests.

To verify your progress or final solution, run the unit tests associated with that file.

Running Tests
----------------
Every exercise comes with a unit tests. Running the file will run the tests for you and you will receive a CLI message telling you whether your tests are passing or failing. To run the tests run this command:
```
python3 <path-to-file/name-of-file.py>
```
For instance, to run the tests of the `reverseString` exercise found in the `beginner` directory (assuming you are in the home directory) run:
```
python3 beginner/reverseString.py
```

These programming exercises are originally from [Free Code Camp's](http://freecodecamp.com) set of algorithm challenges.
I ported them for use in a Python environment for learning purposes; no ownership over the originals is intended.
