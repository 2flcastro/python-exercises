Python Programming Exercises
=============================
Here is a series of Python programming exercises. They are categorized by order of difficulty.

Adding Your Code
------------------
To add the code for your solution, it is recommended that you create a separate git branch.

From your new branch you can open whatever file you like and fill in the designated function with your solution. It is important that you use the function pre-defined in the files so that they work with the intended unit tests.

To verify your progress or final solution, run the unit test file associated with the exercise.

Running Tests
----------------
Every exercise comes with a unit test file that can be found in the `tests` directory.
Ex: Say you want to run the unit tests for the 'reverseString' exercise found in the `beginner` directory:
```
python3 tests/beginner/reverseString_tests.py
```

Credits

These programming exercises are originally from [Free Code Camp](freecodecamp.com)'s set of algorithm challenges.
I ported them for use in a Python environment for learning purposes; no complete ownership over the originals is intended.
