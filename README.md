Python Programming Exercises
=============================
Here is a series of Python programming exercises. They are categorized by order of difficulty.

Adding Your Code
------------------
To add the code for your solution, it is recommended that you create a new git branch.
```
git checkout -b <name-of-new-branch>
```

From your new branch you can open whatever file you like and use the provided function to create your solution. It is important that you use the function provided in the files so that they work with the intended unit tests. The output of the solution will be used to run the unit tests.

To verify your progress or final solution, run the unit test file associated with the exercise.

Running Tests
----------------
Every exercise comes with a unit test file that can be found in the `tests` directory.

Ex: Say you want to run the unit tests for the `reverseString.py` exercise found in the `beginner` directory, run the following command:
```
python3 tests/beginner/reverseString_tests.py
```
You will receive a CLI prompt telling whether you passed or failed the unit tests.

These programming exercises are originally from [Free Code Camp's](http://freecodecamp.com) set of algorithm challenges.
I ported them for use in a Python environment for learning purposes; no ownership over the originals is intended.
