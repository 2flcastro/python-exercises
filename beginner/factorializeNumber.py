# Facorialize A Number
# --------------------------
# Return a factorial of the provided ineger.
# If the integer is represented with the letter "n", a
# factorial is the product of all positive integers less
# than or equal to n.
#
# Factorials are often represented with the notation "n!"
# Ex: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
# 
# NOTE: you can return whatever variable you want from your
# function - no necessarily one named "num" - so long as it
# is your solution.
